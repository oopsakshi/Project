# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation is essential for businesses to tailor their marketing efforts and improve customer retention. By applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to this dataset, we can segment customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, frequency of purchases, and the monetary value of their purchases. This segmentation allows businesses to identify their most valuable customers, those who may be at risk of churning, and opportunities to engage with less active customers.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer information and their purchasing behavior from an e-commerce platform. The key columns in the dataset include:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `age`: Age of the customer.
- `gender`: Gender of the customer.
- `income`: Annual income of the customer.
- `spending_score`: A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior.
- `membership_years`: Number of years the customer has been a member.
- `purchase_frequency`: Number of purchases made by the customer.
- `preferred_category`: The category of products the customer most frequently buys.
- `last_purchase_amount`: The amount spent by the customer in their most recent purchase.

## Key Insights from RFM Analysis
The RFM analysis segments customers into the following categories:
